        <h1>Welcome to the OTC Market Experiment</h1>
        <p>
            In this experiment, you will participate in an Over-the-Counter (OTC) trading environment. 
            OTC trading is characterized by participants negotiating directly with each other to determine 
            the prices and quantities for trading.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will be assigned a role as either a <strong>Buyer</strong> or a <strong>Seller</strong>.
            Buyers will make bids to purchase units, while Sellers will make offers to sell their units. 
            Your objective is to maximize your earnings by trading effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, you will be assigned an <strong>information level</strong>, which can be either <strong>high</strong> or <strong>low</strong>. 
            The information level will determine how much market information you have access to during the trading phase.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each Buyer can negotiate with Sellers to find the best possible price.</li>
